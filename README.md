# Ravi Devgam | Calisthenics-Coding Combo

Welcome to the **WhoRavi.github.io** homepage! This is not your average portfolio — unless your average portfolio can do a planche and debug at the same time.

## About `index.html`

This HTML file is the digital dojo of Ravi Devgam, where handstands meet Hugging Face APIs and data wrangling is just another day at the office (or gym). The page is styled with a sleek, dark theme — because light mode is for people who like squinting.

### Features
- **Header:** Name, tagline, and a subtle flex about balancing handstands and hugging APIs.
- **Who Am I?**
  - Fun facts about Ravi, including his ability to planche better than most can sit straight, and his love for solo rides and swimming (no playlist required).
  - Data Scientist at Honeywell by day, gravity wrestler by night.
  - Will freelance for cool projects and coffee.
- **Projects**
  - Links to AI Doc Translator, devc.site, and a GitHub full of "final-final-fix" commits.
- **Stalk Me (Professionally):**
  - GitHub and LinkedIn links for your professional stalking needs.
- **Footer:**
  - Copyright, current year (auto-updating!), and a reminder that this site is fueled by data, deadlifts, and dark mode.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Marvel at the combination of tech, fitness, and humor.
3. Click some links. Maybe hire Ravi. Or just get inspired to do a push-up.

Enjoy the site — and remember, if you can’t do a planche, at least you can view one in HTML!
